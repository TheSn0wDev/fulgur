# Fulgur – Open Source All-Terrain RC Vehicle

**Fulgur** is a modern, modular, and open-source RC vehicle designed for developers, makers, and robotics enthusiasts. Built for both on-road speed and off-road agility, Fulgur combines powerful embedded software in C++ with flexible hardware architecture to support rapid iteration and customization.

## 🧠 Core Features:

- 🧩 **Modular architecture** with clear separation of control logic, communication interfaces, and hardware drivers
- 🎮 **Wireless control** via gamepads (e.g. PS5, Xbox) using a Bluetooth bridge
- 📡 **Real-time communication** over Wi-Fi or alternative wireless protocols
- 🎥 **FPV-ready** with onboard camera streaming and latency-optimized networking
- 🔌 **Component-agnostic**: swap sensors, motors, or control methods with minimal code change

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:

- Embedded C++ with high-level modular patterns
- SDL3 for gamepad input
- WebSocket / UDP / Serial for comms
- Optional integration with Raspberry Pi, ESP32, or other microcontrollers

## 🌍 Why Fulgur?

Fulgur is not just a toy — it's a platform. Whether you're learning embedded systems, building a robotics prototype, or exploring autonomous navigation, Fulgur gives you the foundation to move fast and adapt faster.
